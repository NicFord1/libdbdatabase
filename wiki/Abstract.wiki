Our team has decided to create a library application, which will be written in PHP and connect to a MySQL database. The project is called _[http://LibDBDatabase.Nicks-Net.us LibDBDatabase]_, which will be implemented as a library where users can add, remove, and find items. Items in the library consist of books, catalogs, peer-reviewed journals, novels, music CDs, educational and entertainment DVDs, and other media supported by a plugin system. Items in the database will have a weight attributed with them that represents its ratings. When a customer has an item for check-out or searches for an item, the library will make a recommendation to him or her based on ratings and relevance of other similar items.

The application will implement several criteria listed below ([FunctionRequirements]):

    * A Search function, where one can search the library database using various criteria (subject, data, author, publisher, publish date, rating, price) to find a specific book or a series of books matching the query. 

    * Several usertypes, which consists of admin (database managers), teller (sales person), and customer (adult, child, and senior citizen). 

    * Abilities of the three usertypes defined below:
         # *Admin* has the ability to add, remove, and search items in the database.
         # *Teller* has the ability to search items in the database and check in/out items to a user.
         # *Customer* has the ability to search the database.

    * Item recommendations will be offered. Items may be recommended based on the subject, data, author, publisher, publish date, ratings, price, and user reviews. 

    * Items will be categorized in the database by various criterions mentioned above. 

    * The library database will have a GUI that allows users to easily perform the available actions as appropriate to their usertype.
